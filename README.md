This is the beta version of Customa. Due to time constraint it is unlikely that this will see a lot of updates, but maybe I'll pick it up someday.
I mostly want to push it out as I am fairly proud of the latest setup and it might be used by anyone who intends on building larger, import-reliant themes.
